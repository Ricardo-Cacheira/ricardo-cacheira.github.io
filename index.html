            I'm an independent gameplay and tools engineering contractor, currently based in Edinburgh, UK. I work with a wide variety of clients, from individuals looking for someone to build their dream game to independent studios and startups that need a talented
            professional to help to develop their projects. I graduated from Birmingham City University, with First-class Honours in BSc. Interactive Entertainment: Game Development, and have commercial AAA programming experience working as an Online
            Tools Designer at Rockstar North. As an independent contractor, I take a lot of joy in being able to continually work on a variety of different projects as it forces me to interact with new technologies, work with new people and consistently
            allow me to keep growing and learning. There's nothing like the freedom of being able to always work on the most interesting up-and-coming opportunities that present themselves to you. My passion truly lies in game development. I love being
            able to design and develop interactive experiences that can be enjoyed globally by a wide-range of different audiences. I also love being able to create and experiment with the development of indie tools, as it gives me a chance to try and
            give back to the community I work in and hopefully make the lives of my fellow developers easier. If I'm not working hard with clients, I'm probably working on a personal project, participating in a game jam, powerlifting or exploring the
            gorgeous highlands of my local area. I'm always on the lookout for new clients with interesting projects to work on, so if you think that's you, send me an email!

                Temple of Giants was a project developed during my last semester which I took abroad at <a href="https://www.buas.nl/en/programmes/creative-media-and-game-technologies" class="highlight"> BUas</a>. It is the first project in which I worked
                with a bigger team (16 people). I was the programming lead for this project and worked alongside VAs and designers to make our final boss Medusa a memorable experience. This project taught me a lot about working in a larger multi-diciplinary
                team and the importance of team leads to facilitate communication and project progress.
